Look at my eyes, Faye. One of them is a fake because I lost it in an accident. Since then, Iâ€™ve been seeing the past in one eye and the present in the other. So, I thought I could only see patches of reality, never the whole picture. I felt like I was watching a dream I could never wake up from. Before I knew it, the dream was over
